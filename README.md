# Benchmarking Variational Algorithms for Quantum Chemistry

This repository was created as part of the Msc thesis on “The Effect of Noise on the Performance of Variational Algorithms for Quantum Chemistry”.

The project goal was to view how noise changes which ansatz is the best for a quantum chemistry problem using VQE. Additionally we assess the ability of the expressibility measure to identify suitable circuits for VQE applied to a quantum chemistry use case.
